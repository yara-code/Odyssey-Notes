Our Notes App is called Odyssey Notes. The user can create notes and delete them. Odyssey notes also has two other features, and the first is searching for a city or country to check the weather. The Odyssey notes app also has a feature that allows the user to review current news. A list of news is displayed, and the user can click on a piece of particular news and save it as a note.

## Main Screen/ Main Page: :house:

Odyssey Notes is displayed as the title on top, and there are three icons below the title that say New Notes, News, and Weather. Below those Icons, a list of notes should appear there, and if there are no notes, nothing should appear below the icons.

## New Notes Icon: :heavy_plus_sign:

When the New Notes Icon is clicked, the user will be directed to the NotePad page. The user can type a new note and click Save. Once the Save button is clicked, the user is taken back to the main page, displaying their new note.

## News Icon: :newspaper:

When the News Icon is clicked, the user is directed to the News page. On that page is a list of news articles, and when clicked, the user is given more details on that article. The user is given three options, Close, Save, Full Article. If the user clicks Save, the content of the article will be saved into a new note. If the user clicks Full Article, they will be directed to the URL page of the article, and the full article will be displayed.

## Weather Icon: :sunny: :cloud: :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain: :snowflake:

When the Weather Icon is clicked, the user is directed to the Weather page. The weather (including temperature, humidity, pressure, and visibility) of a particular city or country is shown on that page.
There is also text input for search. That search allows the user to search for a city or country to check the weather. This page also has a feature that will enable the user to switch from light mode to dark mode and vice versa.


## Deleting a Note: :heavy_multiplication_x:

To delete a note, the user will have to select a note, and they will be taken to that note page. The user can then click the delete button on the page, and once the note is deleted, they will be directed back to the main page.
